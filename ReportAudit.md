Finding Severity breakdown

All vulnerabilities discovered during the audit are classified based on their potential severity and have the following classification:

Severity | Description

Critical | Bugs leading to assets theft, fund access locking, or any other loss funds to be transferred to any party.

High     | Bugs that can trigger a contract failure. Further recovery is possible only by manual modification of the contract state or replacement.

Medium   | Bugs that can break the intended contract logic or expose it to DoS attacks, but do not cause direct loss funds.
